# WingView

A simple script to take a Snapshot file from Behringer WING-Edit and draw the routing network.
See it deployed at [https://server.ac/wingview/](https://server.ac/wingview/)

Everything runs locally on your Browser, the snapshot you select is never uploaded to any server.

This software is licensed under the GPL3, see LICENSE.md, and was thrown together in just a few hours. So donÂ´t expect any fancy (or even bug-free or feature-rich) code or features. Please add questions/comments/bugs as github issues, pull requests are very welcome!

To actually draw the network, [visnetwork from visjs](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/) is used.
